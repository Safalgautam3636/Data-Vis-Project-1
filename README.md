### Project 1 - Tech Companies and Mental Health
A mental health institution is investigating mental health issues in tech companies. There is concern
about where mental health stems, that is, if it is hereditary, appears at a specific age, prevalent in
certain geographic locations, and also if someoneâ€™s job has a role to play in mental health. Also,
attention is being drawn to whether companies are taking mental health seriously and, if so, are they
providing any benefits with mental health in mind and also treat mental health employees fairly, giving
them time to recover if needed. There is even concern about if individuals are being treated for their
mental health issues.
