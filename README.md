### Project 1 - Tech Companies and Mental Health
A mental health institution is investigating mental health issues in tech companies. There is concern
about where mental health stems, that is, if it is hereditary, appears at a specific age, prevalent in
certain geographic locations, and also if someone’s job has a role to play in mental health. Also,
attention is being drawn to whether companies are taking mental health seriously and, if so, are they
providing any benefits with mental health in mind and also treat mental health employees fairly, giving
them time to recover if needed. There is even concern about if individuals are being treated for their
mental health issues.

The mental health institution has hired you to investigate the above issues using some data they have
collected (see details of attributes below). You are required to explore the data and use appropriate
graphs/plots and narratives (via text/markdown code) for each plot in order to describe your findings
and tell your story based on the data.
